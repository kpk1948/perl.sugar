ABOUT
=====
This is a fork of Markus Zeller's Perl Sugar. Original documentation can be found at
http://github.com/markuszeller/perl.sugar

I have made some improvements that Markus will hopefully commit back into the main trunk.
These include:
* Support for POD inline documentation
* Support for regular expressions
* Cleaner block recognition

Installation
============
Download the perl.sugar and copy to ~/Library/Application Support/Espresso/Sugars/
Restart Espresso

Of course you can install manually with git.
git clone git://github.com/jrsinclair/perl.sugar.git
copy that file to ~/Library/Application Support/Espresso/Sugars/
