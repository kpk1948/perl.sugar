About
=====
This is a fork of Markus Zeller's Perl Sugar. Original documentation can be found at
[http://github.com/markuszeller/perl.sugar](http://github.com/markuszeller/perl.sugar)

I have made some improvements that Markus will hopefully commit back into the main trunk.
These include:

* Support for POD inline documentation
* Support for regular expressions
* Cleaner block recognition

Installation
============
Download `perl.sugar` and copy to `~/Library/Application Support/Espresso/Sugars/` and
then restart Espresso

Of course you can install manually with git.

    git clone git://github.com/jrsinclair/perl.sugar.git

and copy that file to

    `~/Library/Application Support/Espresso/Sugars/`
